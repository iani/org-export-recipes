Collection of files containing snippets for customizing exports from org-mode to latex (pdf) and/or html.

* Requirements

Org-mode v 9.0 or later is required to use the =LATEX_COMPILER= option for setting the compiler to xelatex or lualatex.

The examples here were compiled to pdf using:

- GNU EMACS 25.1.1
- Org mode version 9.0.2
- pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016), xpdf version 3.04
- macos 10.12.4

* Usage

The recipes are files containing export customization settings for org-mode files.  Each setting is one or more lines of org-mode. Each line sets one or more properties for the file, which customize export to html or latex.

The recipe files are contained in folder =recipes=.  To use a recipe in an org-mode file, insert the recipe file in the org-mode file using the insert file command (C-x i).  Alternatvely, use the command =org-export-insert-recipe= which is defined in file =org-export-recipes.el= and bound to =h-c i= (functiom-key-c, i).
